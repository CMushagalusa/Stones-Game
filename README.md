# Stones Game

## ðŸ“Œ Description
**Stones Game** is a simple two-player game implemented in **Java**, where players take turns picking stones from a pile following specific rules. The game ensures a fair and structured way for players to interact, enforcing conditions to maintain gameplay integrity.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
1. Players start by choosing an **odd number of stones** greater than 1.
2. Each player is prompted to enter their **name**.
3. The **first player** selects a number of stones from the pile (between 1 and half of the total available stones).
4. The **second player** can take **up to twice** the number of stones the first player took.
5. Players continue taking turns until there are **no stones left**.
6. The **winner** is determined based on the number of stones collected:
   - If the total number of stones collected by a player is **odd**, they **win**.
   - Otherwise, the other player wins.
